# PVault

Python CLI based password manager; Generate, store & retrieve your passwords easily & efficiently. Passwords are stored in sqlite db and encrypted with AES256-CBC encryption and Fernet for the data in the database.

Got the inspiration for this project from my gee [@oluwafenyi](https://github.com/oluwafenyi) from [https://github.com/oluwafenyi/password-vault](https://github.com/oluwafenyi/password-vault) where he built the same exact thing. I'm basically upgrading his work but written from scratch.

##### You will be asked for a master password the very first time you run the script. The master password is what protects the other passwords and should be kept secure because it can't be reset.
