# PVault

Python CLI based password manager; Generate, store & retrieve your passwords easily & efficiently.

Got the inspiration for this project from my Boss [@oluwafenyi](https://github.com/oluwafenyi) from [https://github.com/oluwafenyi/password-vault](https://github.com/oluwafenyi/password-vault) where he built the same exact thing. I'm basically upgrading his work but written from scratch.
